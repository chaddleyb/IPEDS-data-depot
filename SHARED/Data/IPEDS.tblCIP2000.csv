The reporting codes for these programs have undergone substantial renumbering (summarized below). (Refer to the Crosswalk in table 3  for a specification of the renumbering system that was implemented).  * Dental residency programs (located in Series 51.28 in the CIP-1990) have been moved to (and should be reported under)  Series 60.01;  * Medical residency programs (previously located in Series  51.29) have been moved to (and should be reported under)  Series 60.02; * Veterinary residency programs (previously in Series 51.30) have been moved to (and should be reported under) Series 60.03. Residency programs are designed to prepare medical doctors (M.D.), or osteopaths (DO), dentists (DDS, D.M.D.), and veterinarians (D.V.M.) for certification as practitioners of recognized specialties in their respective professions.  These programs are approved and accredited by designated professional associations and require from one to five years to complete, depending on the program.  Medical residencies usually require completion of an internship after the M.D. degree for program entry, while requirements vary for dentistry and veterinary programs.  These programs are offered by professional schools, independent teaching hospitals and clinics, and other approved facilities.  Data on residency program enrollments and completions are only partially collected and analyzed by the U.S. Department of Education.  Residency programs that also result in an academic degree completion, such as an MS or Ph.D., should be reported under one of the Clinical Sciences codes (51.0501, 51.2501 or Series 26.) in chapter I, rather than in a residency code located in this chapter.",CWOPA\c-daniwels,2017-09-21 15:42:53.8274772
